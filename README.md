# SparkFund
The objective of this project is to develop a customizable donation platform that enables micropayments while eliminating transaction fees. This will empower individuals to contribute according to their capacity

## What is the problem?

### People affected by situations beyond their control are left vulnerable and rely on external aid to cover medical supplies.

### Cash donations carry handling risks, and online fundraisers incur costs due to payment gateway fees.

## What is the solution?

### Our proposed solution is to implement the Open Payments API to create a website dedicated to donations, customizable according to each campaign, which reduces or eliminates fees, and also facilitates micropayments so empathetic individuals can donate amounts according to their means.

## What are the benefits?

### - Facilitates small donations (micropayments)  
### - Reduces or eliminates transaction fees  
### - Removes the need to use payment gateways  
### - Reduces the risk of bank data theft  
### - Simplifies the user experience by only requiring wallet input, amount entry, and transaction confirmation  
### - Accessible for different economic capacities  
### - Eliminates issues related to currency exchange  

## Value Proposition

- *For the Donor:* Donate without feeling the expense, and be an active part of the solution. Your money has a visible impact, and you choose where it goes.  
- *For NGOs:* Receive a steady and predictable flow of income from a new generation of donors who feel more engaged than ever.  
- *For the Business:* Create a financial and social ecosystem that links philanthropy with financial services.

## HIGH-LEVEL TECHNICAL SOLUTION DESCRIPTION

### The solution consists of developing a web donation platform customizable by campaign, integrated with the Open Payments API, to allow easy donations, micropayments, and fee reduction. The architecture is proposed as a client-server model with scalable and secure components.

### 1. FRONTEND  
*Technology:* React.js  
*Functionality:* Campaign and donation form visualization

### 2. BACKEND  
*Technology:* Node.js with Express  
*Functionality:*  
- User management  
- Open Payments integration  
- Transaction logging

### 3. DATABASE  
*Technology:* MySQL  
*Functionality:*  
- Storage of users, campaigns, and donations

### 4. INFRASTRUCTURE  
*Technology:* WAMPSERVER  
*Functionality:*  
- Local web development infrastructure

## Feasibility, Impact, and Sustainability Analysis

### Feasibility

- *Potential Market:* Over 80% of the population in Mexico City has access to a smartphone, and 50% make online purchases, ensuring a user base familiar with digital transactions.  
- *Transaction Cost:* This is where Interledger shines. Transaction costs are significantly lower than gateways like Stripe or Openpay, making micro-donations of $5 or $10 pesos economically viable and profitable for the business. The issue of high percentage fees on small amounts is eliminated.  
- *Acceptance and Trust:* Although Interledger is less known to end users, the platform interface will generate trust, not the underlying technology.

### Impact

- *Social Impact:* An inclusive donation culture would be promoted, allowing more people to contribute. Interledger technology makes every peso count, increasing the impact of collective donations.  
- *User Economic Impact:* Micropayments remain key. The amount is so small that it does not affect the user's finances, while the emotional impact of actively participating in a cause is significant.

### Sustainability

- *Financial Sustainability:* The business model becomes more profitable thanks to Interledger's low costs. Revenue would come from a small commission on each micro-transfer, corporate sponsorships, and the platform's ability to attract and retain users at scale.
